# Green-House-Monitoring-System-with-Wireless-Sensor-Networks
The continuous improvement in science and technology has significantly impacted the development of modern tools in the agricultural sector. For example, smart greenhouse monitoring systems have evolved to meet data transmission, remote monitoring, and data acquisition requirements. In this project, a smart greenhouse monitoring system was developed using the concept of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The WSN consists of small-size wireless sensor nodes equipped with a radio for communicating in the network. The greenhouse monitoring system consists of the WSN, a data display system, remote control system, management system and a login management system. The monitoring system detects the environmental conditions and alerts the grower/farmer once a threshold value is exceeded. The system parameters can also be viewed on a designated database server to know the status of the system and support crop growing and general farm management decision-making. The system was implemented and tested to ensure its proper functioning.
